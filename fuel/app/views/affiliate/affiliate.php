	<p>Plain and simple, we are c00l. We do not run the classic boring referral program. We are going for an experimental semi-affiliate one. </p>
	<p>What does that mean for you?</p>
	<p>It means you earn at least 10% of what your referrals spend + virtual rewards.</p>
	<p>Yes, as in real cash! You will be paid via Paypal after it is confirmed your referrals have not requested refunds or other nasty events that can prevent us and subsequentally you from being rewarded.</p>
