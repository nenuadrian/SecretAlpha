# Overview

Audio trailer on Youtube: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6thfiGb-b7c

A lot of work has gone into this, but it not a fully documented project.

It's been through years of development with this being its 3rd itteration.

The project is not under active development with milestones in-place.

It is built upon the https://fuelphp.com MVC framework.

# Main Features

1. Audio AI (woman, same as trailer) voice speaks when interacting with the game

2. Futuristic minimalistic Bootstrap-based UI, mobile ready, made to feel like an app

3. Point and click based missions with servers of multiple types (file servers, email and database)

4. In-game Mission designer with BBCode like syntax features

5. Upgradable knowledge & skills

6. Rewards system


# Simple Setup

You need a webserver (e.g. MAMP/WAMP/XAMPP) able to run PHP (tested with 7.3) and an MySQL database (LAMP stack).

1. Install `composer` (the PHP dependency management system - `brew install composer` for MacOS) and run `composer install`

2. You will need to create an empty Database in MySQL - it's name is not relevant but you will need it in the next step. For MAMP, you would go to `http://localhost:8888/phpMyAdmin5`

3. Visit `http://localhost/public_html` - this may be different if you are using another port or directory structure, e.g. `http://localhost:8888/sr/public_html` and follow the setup process

# Cron jobs

You may want to setup cron tasks to run the following pages once in a while

your-url/cron/rankings

your-url/cron/emails

e.g.

*/2 * * * * wget -O - http://localhost/cron/emails >/dev/null 2>&1

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cron

# Linting

Checking PHP syntax
```
./fuel/vendor/bin/phplint ./ --exclude=vendor
```

# Mobile app

One approach is to use these repositories: 
 * iOS: https://github.com/nenuadrian/iOS-website-elegant-rendering-swift-app
 * Android: https://github.com/nenuadrian/android-website-elegant-rendering

# Secret Republic V3 (OLDER W/ MORE FEATURES)

V3 is much older, less organized and not respecting of any patterns what-so-ever in code, mostly based on a framework written from scratch.

Find version 3 here: https://github.com/nenuadrian/Secret-Republic-Hacking-Browser-Game-V3
